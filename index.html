					<h3>Eden</h3>
					<img src="assets/images/work/eden.jpg" alt="Eden flash game" />

					A demo of a game created as part of my interaction module for my degree
					course. After researching a topic of choice, I chose photosynthesis, I
					had to produce an interactive toy based on a concept of the topic using
					Flash. I used this as an opportunity to learn Actionscript 3 in great
					detail and to aim at producing something at an ambitious scale. Want to
					find out more? Have a go!

					<h3>Kitchen</h3>
					<img src="assets/images/work/kitchen.jpg" alt="3D Model of a kitchen designed by Aaron Faber" />

					My first major 3D project was to create a Kitchen from scratch. I created everything
					from the models and texturing, to the lighting. The kitchen was made to real-life
					proportions.

					<h3>BIAS Brand</h3>
					<img src="assets/images/work/bias.jpg" alt="Bias Brand" />

					In this small project I was asked to rebrand the
					<a href="http://www.brunel.ac.uk/about/acad/health/healthres/researchareas/bbias">
					Brunel Institue for Ageing Studies </a> organisation. This included creating a new
					logo and implementing the branding on business cards and letter heads.
					</li>-->

					<h3>Text Manipulation: Negative</h3>
					<img src="assets/images/work/negative_text.gif" alt="Text Manipulation - Positive" />

					Here I have tried to create a pessimistic and depressive mood with text
					and textual symbols.
					</li>-->
					<!--<li>
					<h3>Computer Lab: Warning Poster</h3>
					<img src="assets/images/work/warning_poster.jpg" alt="Computer Lab: Warning Poster" />

					This is a warning poster I created for technical staff at the Computer Laboratory
					at Brunel University. It warns against the use of Mobile Phones, Personal Laptops
					and Eating and Drinking inside the Lab rooms. The poster was displayed in several
					of the Lab rooms at my University.

					<li>
						<h3>NHS Addiction Unit</h3>
						<img src="assets/images/work/addiction_unit.jpg" alt="NHS Addiction Unit">
						Part of the NHS Addiction Unit group project. My group was chosen as one of the
						best performing and were asked to come and present our ideas to a panel of
						executives and project managers at the main offices of Reading Room. This mock
						up was used to demonstrate our design ideas from our pitch. I was responsible
						for the majority of the front end development. This was one of my first tastes of
						the JQuery UI.
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Dive: The World In Pictures</h3>
						<img src="assets/images/work/dive.jpg" alt="Dive. The world in pictures">
						This was an unofficial internal project that I undertook at my first placement
						for <a href="http://www.lbi.co.uk">LBi</a> in the summer of 2009. The brief of this project was
						to create a more intuitive way of searching through and exploring photographs on Flickr.
						I'm currently redeveloping the application.

					<h3><a href="http://youtu.be/phh-7-WmJ1I"> Two Snails and a Window </a></h3>
					<img src="assets/images/work/two_snails.jpg" alt="Two snails and a window" />

					The culmination of our Film module (second year). This was a group project. During
					the course of the year everyone had produced a script and storyboard for their own
					concept of a 3 minute film. As part of the group work we selected our favourite script
					and then proceeded to convert it into a film/ animation. In the end we decided to
					produce a stop motion animation. I was principal photographer, animator and sound
					producer.
					</li>-->
					<!--<li>
					<h3>London 2012</h3>
					<img src="assets/images/work/london.jpg" alt="The London Olympics 2012" />

					This was my first project at University. The task was to conduct research on the potential
					benefits and adverse effects of the Olympics games in London and then come to an informed
					decision about whether I supported or was against the Olympic Games. The document is a
					short written argument followed by a series of 5 posters which express my opinion.
					I used Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop and Indesign to create this artefact.
